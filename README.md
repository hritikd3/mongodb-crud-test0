## Technology Usedâš“

### MongoDB:

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers a flexible and scalable solution for managing data. It allows for the storage of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. MongoDB provides powerful querying capabilities and easy integration with various programming languages.

## Installation ðŸ“œ

To set up and use MongoDB locally, follow these steps:

- Install MongoDB Community Edition by following the official installation guide for your operating system. You can find the installation guide here.

- Once MongoDB is installed, you can start the MongoDB server.

- (Optional) Install MongoDB Compass, a visual tool for managing MongoDB databases. MongoDB Compass provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the database. You can download MongoDB Compass from the official website here.

## `Usage` ðŸ™Œ

To use the MongoDB CRUD Test project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/hritikd3/mongodb-crud-test0.git

- Navigate to the project directory: cd mongodb-crud-test0

- Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn: npm install or yarn install

- In the project's root directory, create a .env file and set up your MongoDB Atlas URI. For example:

``` javascript
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
Replace <username>, <password>, <cluster-url>, and <database-name> with your own MongoDB Atlas credentials.
```

- Run the application: node index.js

- This will connect to the MongoDB database using the provided URI and perform CRUD operations.
